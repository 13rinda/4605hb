<h1>4605 Henri Bourassa – Syndicate Accountability Report</h1>
<p><strong>Prepared by:</strong> Feedback gathered by a group of concerned Co-Owners</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> November 8th, 2025</p>

<!-- Purpose Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Purpose of this Report</h2>
<p> <b>!! Please read if you care the well being and finances of the building!!</b> <br></br>

This report has been prepared to <b>raise awareness</b> among all co-owners regarding serious governance, financial, and compliance concerns observed within the current Syndicat des copropriétaires du 4605 Henri-Bourassa Ouest.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to promote accountability, transparency, and lawful administration in the management of our shared property — not to assign blame, but to protect the collective interests and investments of every co-owner.</p>
<p>The syndicate is legally bound by the Civil Code of Québec (Articles 1038–1109) to act with diligence, good faith, and impartiality in managing the building, its finances, and its safety. When these obligations are not respected, the result is loss of trust, reduced property value, and exposure to legal and financial risks for all co-owners.</p>
</div>

<!-- Section 1 -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Section 1 – Concerns Regarding Potential Conflicts of Interest and Administrative Mismanagement</h2>
  <p>(Anonymous concerns gathered from multiple co-owners)</p>
  <p>This section summarizes questions and observations raised by several co-owners regarding potential conflicts of interest, lack of impartial oversight, and questionable financial practices within the current syndicate administration. These points are presented not as accusations, but as matters requiring clarification and transparency in accordance with the Civil Code of Québec, particularly Articles 321, 322, and 1070 to 1077 C.C.Q., which impose duties of prudence, diligence, honesty, and loyalty on all administrators acting in a fiduciary capacity for the co-ownership.</p>

  <h3>1.1 Governance and Lack of Unbiased Oversight</h3>
  <p>The current structure of the administration appears to be heavily influenced by personal relationships among its members. When an administration is composed of close friends or allied individuals, objectivity and accountability can be compromised.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Under Article 322 C.C.Q., administrators must avoid situations where personal interests conflict with the syndicate’s interests.</li>
    <li>Administrative decisions — including expenditures, project selection, and hiring — must be collective and transparent.</li>
    <li>Work prioritized often aligns with tasks administrators can perform personally, while critical issues (carpet replacement, lighting, floor/mold handling) are delayed or ignored.</li>
    <li>This risks physical deterioration of the building and decreases property value for co-owners.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Missing or Unexplained Revenues</h3>
  <p>Several co-owners have expressed concern regarding the absence of transparency in recording certain revenues in the syndicate’s financial statements:</p>

  <h4>a. Key Sales (Medico Lobby Keys)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Building keys sold, but no record of revenue appears in statements.</li>
    <li>Missing key boxes with no accounting for quantity sold, price, or deposit into official accounts.</li>
    <li>Violates Article 1070 C.C.Q. requiring accurate and accessible financial records.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>b. Parking Lot Rentals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Questions about the number of parking spaces owned, rented, and to whom.</li>
    <li>No written record of revenues or equitable access process.</li>
    <li>Potential self-dealing by administrators renting spaces at higher rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>c. Savings Account Interest and Bank Charges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Interest from savings accounts missing in statements.</li>
    <li>Bank charges increased sharply (~$1,138 → ~$1,739) without explanation.</li>
    <li>Page 7 of financial statements lacks signature — questions of validity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>d. Administration Member Expenses</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>One administrator reportedly paid themselves ~$19,000 (March–October 2025) — requires transparent justification to co-owners.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Questions Raised by Co-Owners</h3>
  <p>Concerns regarding disbursements, authorizations, and budget inconsistencies include:</p>

  <div class="question-bubble">How many cheques have been issued and cashed with only one admin. authorized signature? And to whom?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">How much money has been withdrawn or transferred by a single administrator? ~$19 829.46 paid to one admin member this year (not including admin salary). For what? Where are the receipts? Who authorized this huge amount to be taken from the bank account of "Syndicat des copropriétaires du 4605 Henri-Bourassa Ouest"?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">Are proper voting and approval procedures being followed before funds are allocated or disbursed? How are you deciding the next renovation process? Are all 3 members aware and taking votes following the procedure by law? How come some are unaware?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">On the budget under Hydro-Québec, the current year to date is ~$60,000 and you are anticipating $90,000, what is causing this $30,000 increase?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">On the budget under the category Transport and Parking, this year it is at $1,256.00, but last year it was at $465.00. Why is it more this year? This year was a difference of $800. What was this for?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">On the budget under the category “Ventilation, Fans, Filters, Ducts”, how come it went from $141.00 the previous year to $11,563.60? What was the issue, and where is the receipt?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">On the budget under the category of Plumbing Supplies, how come it went from $2,600 to $9,000 this year? Where are the receipts?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">On the budget under the category “Special Project Contractors” is what exactly, and how did it go from $2,000 to $108,000? Flood contractors? Was RBQ on receipt? Where are the receipts?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">On the budget, under the category “Electrical Supplies,” what exactly is the list that costs $4,200?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">On the budget, under the category “Net Amounts,” it was never written like this in previous years. We want to know the current amount in the bank account for the day-to-day account, the contingency account and the self-insurance account.</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">On the budget under the category called “Maintenance Supplies Expenses,” it was $4,000 last year and now it is at $21,699. What exactly is this, and where are the receipts?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">Administration visits the bank two times per month (normally), so why is it expensed at 3 times for gas?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">Ouest side ventilation on the roof was broken, and Honeywell issued a quote of ~$15,000, and this was not fixed as it seems nor was it communicated. Why?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">How come there was no electricity for ~one week in the garage? Why was nothing communicated to the residents? Why were residents' emails concerning this issue not replied? Was this electrical issue caused by the unlicensed work from the administration? If not, what exactly caused the issue and why was there an invoice for $15,000 from the electrician right after? What was this for and has it been repaired?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">How much were the electrician bills for the garage electrical issue that came shortly after Admin installed the cameras? Is it related to this? What caused the issue?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">The syndicate makes money from the garage door opener, keys, and parking. Where is this money documented in the budget?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">The 3rd, 2nd and 1st floor was soaked in water. What caused this issue, and how was it mitigated? How was the flood handled, and how much did it cost? If any contractors worked on it, what was their permit number?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">The garbage bins really smell bad and need to be washed. Does the garbage room have cockroaches? Do we have a cockroach problem?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">The administrators have illegally installed motors and timers on the roof themselves, resulting in inadequate ventilation as the minimum airflow rate is not being met (Law CQLR c B-1.1*), which RBQ license has approved to shut off ventilation at 11am? Why was this done? Who voted on this idea?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">By the declaration, any job above $5,000 needs to be voted by co-owners? How much was the total spend of the new cameras and why was this a priority over other maintenance jobs and why was this not a joint decision?</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">Last year a co-owner caught a discrepancy with the Hydro-Québec number which was displayed $10,000 over billing at the assembly; we need to see actual logged proof of the numbers and not screenshots that could be photoshopped.</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">There are many inconsistencies in procedures and laws being broken, in addition to the financial numbers needing further explanation and legal proof. Article 1071 C.C.Q.: Every co-owner has the right to obtain a copy of these documents or consult. Screenshots can be altered or incomplete and don’t qualify as valid financial proof. The syndicate’s annual financial statements are supposed to be based on verifiable invoices, receipts, and bills — not screenshots.</div>
  <div class="question-bubble">If the syndicate refuses to show the real invoices, that could constitute a breach of transparency and fiduciary duty under Article 322 C.C.Q., which requires administrators to act with prudence, diligence, honesty, and loyalty in the interests of the co-owners.</div>

<!-- Section 2 -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Section 2: RBQ and Legal Compliance Concerns</h2>
<p>This section is Prepared by: Brinda Mailvaganam, Engineer&  RBQ General Contractor (License No. 5862 8967-01). Owner of 13rinda Inc. (Quebec Enterprise No. 1180638968), a building management and construction firm. Former Public Safety agent of Government of Canada</p>
<p>This section provides professional observations regarding recent work carried out in our building. While the administration’s intentions to reduce costs may be well-meaning, several projects have been executed in a manner that violates Québec law, RBQ regulations, and the duties of a syndicate under the Civil Code of Québec, potentially exposing co-owners to financial and safety risks.</p>

<h3>1. Unauthorized and Substandard Construction Work</h3>
<p>Significant renovations this year have cost approximately $200,000, a nearly 40% increase from last year. It is the right of co-owners to know what work was done, by whom, and at what cost, as outlined under the Civil Code of Québec, art. 1079 and 1080, which mandate transparency and prudent management of common property.</p>


<!-- RBQ Section – Concrete Walls / Flood Prevention -->
<div class="rbq-construction-issue">
  <h3>Garage Flood Prevention – Concrete Wall Project</h3>
<p>
  One notable example is the construction of <strong>concrete walls around the garage for flood prevention</strong>. A prototype design was provided by <strong>13rinda Inc.</strong>, with input from a <strong>structural engineer</strong>, with a quoted labour cost of approximately <strong>$10,000</strong>. Instead, the administration chose work to be done by a <strong>contractor personally connected to the current administration</strong> and paid over <strong>$30,000 in labor</strong> to an invoice which did not have an <strong>RBQ license</strong>—a legal requirement. Even when requested, there is <strong>no transparency</strong> in which quotes were submitted for the job, why the contractor was chosen, and what their <strong>license number</strong> is. This exposes co-owners to <strong>liability</strong> and <strong>additional repair costs</strong>. Within a few months, <strong>major cracks</strong> have appeared in the newly constructed walls, raising concerns regarding <strong>structural integrity</strong> and <strong>potential water infiltration</strong>.
</p>

<p>

  <h4>Key Issues:</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>The concrete walls do not meet the height specifications outlined in the original quote.</li>
  <li>The locker section was left incomplete (but the "contractors" were made their full payment).</li>
  <li>
    The principle of controlled joints was not applied, resulting in random cracking.
    <br>
    <img src="cracking.JPG" alt="Random cracking in concrete wall" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:10px;">
  </li>
  <li><strong>Who will be responsible to pay for this mistake? Will it be the co-owners who will need to compensate for the lack of quality work being done?</strong></li>
</ul>

  <p>
    As both the designer of the prototype and a licensed professional, I conclude that the construction is <strong>structurally unsound</strong> and unlikely to meet its intended life expectancy. These issues suggest either <strong>bias due to personal relationships</strong> or a <strong>lack of accountability in contractor selection</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>Legal and Procedural Obligations:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Contractors must be chosen following a transparent selection and voting process.</li>
    <li>The administration has a legal responsibility to verify the qualifications and RBQ licenses of contractors.</li>
    <li>Co-owners’ investments must be protected to ensure funds are spent on high-quality work rather than remedial repairs.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>2. Illegal Outdoor Fence Construction</h3>
<p>The outdoor fence was constructed by Janitor Michael. While Michael is highly regarded, hardworking, and talented, it is not appropriate for Administration to assign him construction work, especially work that requires a valid <strong>RBQ license</strong>, which he does not hold (Construction Code, CQLR c B-1.1, arts. 5–7). Assigning unlicensed personnel to perform construction work is illegal under Quebec law and could expose the syndicate and co-owners to regulatory penalties.</p>

<p>Administration had placed a bench outdoors to create a welcoming space for residents. However, to protect co-owners from liability, a proper safety fence is legally required (Civil Code of Québec, art. 1457; Safety Code, CQLR c S-2.1, art. 1). Instead, Michael was tasked (by *ONE of the admin, without the other admins being aware of this project) with placing two wooden posts and chains.</p>

<!-- Fence Bubble with Two Images -->
<div class="rbq-construction-issue">
  <div style="display:flex; gap:10px; justify-content:center; margin-bottom:15px; flex-wrap:wrap;">
    <img src="fence1.jpg" alt="Illegal or poorly constructed outdoor fence 1" style="width:48%; max-width:300px; height:auto; border-radius:6px;">
    <img src="fence2.jpg" alt="Illegal or poorly constructed outdoor fence 2" style="width:48%; max-width:300px; height:auto; border-radius:6px;">
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resident Safety:</strong> The fence is structurally inadequate, posing a clear hazard under Civil Code of Québec (arts. 1457–1460).</li>
    <li><strong>Financial and Investment Risk:</strong> Substandard construction may reduce property value and require costly future repairs.</li>
    <li><strong>Liability:</strong> Co-owners could be held legally responsible for accidents, and insurance coverage may be denied due to unlicensed work (Civil Code art. 1479; RBQ regulations).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Administration Response:</strong> The administration reportedly stated: “Don’t worry, the building has insurance.”</p>
  
  <p style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.1rem;">
  ⚠️ <strong>INSURANCE WILL NOT COVER ANY DAMAGES OR LAWSUITS RESULTING FROM UNLICENSED WORK!</strong> 
  Co-owners could face <strong>significant financial liability and large fines</strong> if accidents occur due to unlicensed construction. 
  <strong>Why are we knowingly breaking the law to save money?</strong> 
  <strong>Why are we jeopardizing the investments and safety of hundreds of co-owners?</strong>
</p>

</div>



<h3>3. Illegal Electrical Work and Camera Installation</h3>
<p>Approximately ~40 cameras were installed with electrical work performed by the administration without RBQ electrical qualifications. Improper handling of electricity in common areas endangers lives and violates Civil Code of Québec (art. 1457), Construction Code, and RBQ regulations (CQLR c B-1.1, art. 5–7). Insurance may not cover damages or accidents arising from unlicensed work.</p>
<p>The DIY installation led to a major power failure in the garage, requiring professional electricians. Emergency exit lighting was non-functional for nearly a week. Attempts by co-owners to obtain information were ignored, showing a lack of transparency. Concentrated power within administration contributes to legal, safety, and financial risks.</p>

  <div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:15px;">
    <img src="electricity.jpeg" alt="Illegal electrical work after DIY camera installation" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:6px;">
  </div>

  <p style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.1rem;">
    ⚠️ <strong>Questions for the Administration and Co-Owners:</strong><br>
    - What findings did the professional electrical company indicate as the issue with the building after the cameras were installed by the administration themselves?<br>
    - Was there an invoice of <strong>$15,000</strong> by the electrician after this visit?<br>
    - Were the administrators advised of potential overloading of the electrical capacity due to the installation of all additional cameras?<br>
    - We need full transparency. In case of a fire due to the self-installation of these cameras, will the insurance company cover the co-owners?<br>
    - Has a licensed electrician confirmed that the building is currently safe?
  </p>
</div>


<h3>4. Unfinished & Unprofessional Work</h3>
<p>Do-it-yourself installation of cameras left unpatched holes, causing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air leakage affecting energy efficiency.</li>
<li>Exposed, potentially illegal wiring.</li>
<li>Aesthetic damage that can reduce property value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Civil Code of Québec (arts. 1457–1460), co-owners have a right to expect safe, professional maintenance. Transparency and adherence to law are required to protect investments.</p>

<h3>5. Roof Mortor Installation and Fire Safety Concerns</h3>
<p>Roof mortor work performed by administration without RBQ licensing (CQLR c B-1.1, arts. 5–7) and connected to a timer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disables ventilation overnight (11 PM–7 AM).</li>
<li>Prevents proper operation of kitchen fans, dryers, and bathroom ventilation.</li>
<li>Creates fire hazards under Safety Code, CQLR c S-2.1, art. 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exposes co-owners to serious liability.</p>

<h3>6. Ventilation Repairs and Lack of Transparency</h3>
<p>Previous ventilation problem ($15,000 repair) lacked clear documentation on work done, by whom, and costs. Unlicensed repairs increase risks, violating co-owners’ right to information (Civil Code of Québec, art. 342).</p>

<h3>7. Flooding and Improper Response</h3>
<p>Recent flooding affected 1st and 3rd floors; professional mitigation advice was ignored. Consequences include potential mold, increased repair costs, and legal liability (Civil Code of Québec, arts. 1457–1460).</p>

<h3>8. Pending Fines and Prioritization of Mandatory Maintenance</h3>
<p>Building faces $20,000 in fines from the City and RBQ for overdue mandatory maintenance. Syndicate must prioritize legally required repairs over discretionary projects, ensure licensed contractors, and provide full transparency on tasks, priorities, responsible parties, and timelines.</p>

<h3>Final Disclaimer and Call for Transparency</h3>
<p>I, Brinda Mailvaganam, engineer and licensed RBQ general contractor, declined membership and quotes to the administration due to legal and safety concerns. Co-owners should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce unbiased oversight to the administration.</li>
<li>Ensure all construction and safety work is licensed and compliant with Quebec law.</li>
<li>Demand full transparency in operations, repairs, and expenditures.</li>
<li>Limit concentration of power in administration decisions.</li>
<li>Verify contractors’ RBQ licenses before engaging work.</li>
<li>Adhere to professional advice and engineering standards.</li>
<li>Introduce independent oversight to prevent unilateral, potentially illegal decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our shared investments, safety, and long-term building integrity depend on adherence to law, professional standards, and transparent governance.</p>

<!-- Section 3 -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Section 3 – Non-Compliance with Loi 16 and Loi 141</h2>
<p>This section outlines apparent violations and omissions by the syndicate of co-ownership in relation to <strong>Loi 16</strong> (C.C.Q. articles 1072–1073) and <strong>Loi 141</strong> (C.C.Q. article 1074), both of which are mandatory under Québec condominium law. These legal requirements ensure that a co-ownership is managed prudently, transparently, and with financial foresight to protect the interests and safety of all co-owners.</p>

<h3>1. Loi 16 – Étude du fonds de prévoyance et carnet d’entretien</h3>
<p>Under Articles 1072 and 1073 of the Civil Code of Québec, every syndicate must prepare and periodically update:</p>
<ul>
<li>A study of the contingency fund (fonds de prévoyance), which determines the sums necessary to finance major repairs and replacements of the building’s common elements.</li>
<li>A building maintenance logbook (carnet d’entretien), which records all maintenance activities, repairs, and inspections of the property.</li>
</ul>
<p>This study and register must be established by a qualified professional and updated periodically. The goal is to ensure that the building’s structure and systems (roof, plumbing, electrical, exterior, garage, etc.) are monitored, maintained, and properly funded to prevent financial shortfall or structural degradation.</p>

<h4>Observation:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The contingency fund study (étude du fonds de prévoyance) appears not to have been performed or updated, despite this being a legal obligation since the adoption of Bill 16 in 2020.</li>
<li>The maintenance logbook also appears to be non-existent or incomplete, and co-owners have not been presented with it for review.</li>
<li>When co-owners requested access to these records, the administration showed no transparency or willingness to share them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such omissions constitute a clear violation of Articles 1072 and 1073 C.C.Q., as well as a failure of duty under Article 1039 C.C.Q., which requires the syndicate to preserve the immovable and administer the property with prudence and diligence.</p>

<h3>2. Loi 141 – Évaluation de l’immeuble et unité de référence</h3>
<p>Under Loi 141, which came into force progressively since 2020, the syndicate must obtain a certified evaluation of the building’s reconstruction cost in the event of a major loss (fire, flood, etc.). This evaluation must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be conducted by a qualified professional evaluator.</li>
<li>Include a reference unit (unité de référence), used to calculate insurance claims.</li>
<li>Be updated at least every five years.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Observation:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It appears that this evaluation and the reference unit have not been conducted or shared with co-owners.</li>
<li>There is no proof that the syndicate possesses an updated certified evaluation as required by law.</li>
<li>Each co-owner is entitled to a copy of the reference unit report for insurance verification purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Potential Consequences:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the event of a disaster, the syndicate may be underinsured, resulting in significant out-of-pocket losses for co-owners.</li>
<li>The civil liability of the administrators may be engaged under Article 322 of the Civil Code for failing to act with prudence, diligence, and honesty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Consequences of Non-Compliance</h3>
<p>Ignoring these statutory requirements exposes the syndicate to legal non-compliance and puts the entire co-ownership at financial and structural risk. Without these studies and evaluations:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no reliable financial planning for future repairs.</li>
<li>The building’s insurance protection may be invalid or insufficient.</li>
<li>Co-owners’ property values may decline due to uncertainty about the building’s long-term maintenance and compliance status.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transparency, documentation, and compliance with Loi 16 and Loi 141 are not optional—they are legal obligations designed to protect every co-owner’s investment and safety.</p>
</div>



<!-- Section 4 -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Section 4: Privacy and Audio Concerns Regarding Surveillance Systems (Complaint reported by an anonymous co-owner)</h2>
<p>This section documents a formal complaint raised by an anonymous co-owner regarding potential violations of privacy and personal data protection laws following the installation of surveillance cameras throughout the condominium property. Its purpose is to bring awareness to the co-owners and formally acknowledge that the complainant intends to file a complaint with the appropriate provincial authorities, including the Commission d’accès à l’information du Québec (CAI) and any relevant housing or condominium regulatory bodies.</p>

<h3>1. Legal Context in Québec</h3>
<p>In Québec, the right to privacy is a fundamental right protected by several statutes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms</strong> (R.S.Q., c. C-12, section 5): guarantees that “every person has a right to respect for his private life.”</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code of Québec</strong> (articles 35 and 36): prohibits surveillance that invades a person’s private life without justification.</li>
<li><strong>Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector</strong> (CQLR c. P-39.1): governs how organizations—including condominium syndicates—collect, store, and use personal information, including audio and video data.</li>
<li><strong>Act Respecting the Condominium</strong> (CQLR c. C-67.2, articles 1039 and 1077): requires syndicates to act prudently, honestly, and within their authority when managing common property and information related to co-owners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under these frameworks, video surveillance must be justified, proportionate, and minimally intrusive. Audio recording is strictly limited and generally prohibited without explicit written consent and clear signage.</p>

<h3>2. Allegations Raised by the Co-Owner</h3>
<p>The anonymous co-owner has expressed discomfort and concern about the installation, monitoring, and access of the camera system. Specific concerns include:</p>

<h4>a. Audio Surveillance Capabilities</h4>
<p>Some cameras installed in common areas are believed to have built-in microphones capable of recording audio. If active, this would constitute a serious invasion of privacy and a likely violation of the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector. Co-owners must be informed in writing if any device is capable of recording conversations.</p>

<h4>b. Cameras Positioned Toward Private Areas</h4>
<p>Some cameras may capture parts of individual units or private balconies, rather than strictly common areas. This is contrary to Article 36 of the Civil Code of Québec, which prohibits observing or recording individuals in private settings without consent. Such placement exceeds the syndicate’s authority and undermines the right to personal privacy guaranteed by the Charter.</p>

<h4>c. Remote Access and Lack of Logging Controls</h4>
<p>The syndicate administration reportedly has full, real-time access to all camera feeds via personal mobile phones. Feeds can be accessed at any time, without notice, formal policy, or logging. Legally, surveillance data is personal information, and access must be logged, time-stamped, and restricted to authorized purposes (e.g., investigating incidents or ensuring safety). Arbitrary viewing constitutes misuse of personal information under Québec law.</p>

<h4>d. Monitoring and Inappropriate Comments</h4>
<p>The complainant reports incidents of administrators commenting on co-owners’ movements or habits, such as exact times of arrival or departure. This behavior suggests monitoring for non-security purposes, an abuse of authority, and a potential violation of privacy rights under the Charter and Civil Code. Such conduct may also amount to psychological harassment if it creates fear or discomfort among residents.</p>

<h3>3. Broader Implications and Concerns</h3>
<p>These practices raise red flags regarding the administration’s respect for privacy, ethical boundaries, and lawful handling of personal data. Even if the original intention was to increase security, lack of transparency, oversight, and compliance transforms a safety tool into a source of concern and distrust among co-owners. Protecting one’s private life is not merely a personal concern—it is a legal and moral obligation shared by all involved in the administration and management of the co-ownership property.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>Section 5 – The Importance of Unbiased Representation in the Administration</h2>
<p>This section contains a personal statement from Brinda Mailvaganam, presented in good faith and with the intent to promote transparency, lawful governance, and harmony among all members of the syndicate.</p>

<h3>5.1 Current Administrative Situation</h3>
<p>At present, although three members are officially listed in the building’s administrative council, only two individuals appear actively involved in decision-making and internal communications.</p>
<p>The third member, Mr. Ara, has reportedly been removed from the administration’s internal communication channels (including the administrative group chat) after requesting explanations and accountability regarding certain administrative actions. His exclusion, despite remaining an elected administrator on record, raises serious concerns about the legality of internal governance practices and compliance with the Civil Code of Québec.</p>
<p>Under Article 1084 C.C.Q., all administrators must exercise their mandate fully and without obstruction. Informal or unilateral exclusion of an elected administrator is not legally valid and may constitute interference with the democratic function of the syndicate.</p>

<h3>5.2 Personal Observation and Position</h3>
<p>As a co-owner, I, Brinda Mailvaganam, strongly believe that Mr. Ara should continue to serve on the administration. Over the past decade, Ara has consistently shown commitment, diligence, and care for the building’s well-being. His insistence on transparency and accountability should be considered a strength.</p>
<p>The administration must include individuals independent of close personal ties to current members. Without unbiased representation, governance risks being guided by comfort, friendship, or convenience rather than legal compliance and the collective interest of all co-owners.</p>
<p>For these reasons, my unit’s vote will go to Ara in the upcoming election. I urge all co-owners to participate in the General Assembly on November 21, 2025, and vote for individuals who best preserve transparency, legality, and balanced representation.</p>

<h3>5.3 A Call for Constructive Reform</h3>
<p>This statement is not made out of hostility toward the current administration. Nabil and Madjed are intelligent and well-intentioned individuals who, with proper support and oversight, can positively contribute to the building if transparency is maintained.</p>
<p>Accountability is a safeguard for all — it protects administrators and co-owners from suspicion, liability, and miscommunication. I strongly encourage the addition of unbiased candidates unaffiliated with current members to restore equilibrium and ensure lawful, transparent governance.</p>

<h3>5.4 Closing Statement</h3>
<p>I, Brinda Mailvaganam, believe these issues can be resolved without escalating into legal conflict. Let us take the right approach — rooted in transparency, accountability, and mutual respect.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have considered perspectives from both the administration and several co-owners and wish to give the current administration the opportunity to explain their actions before assuming the worst.</li>
<li>With open, honest communication and a collective commitment, a fair and constructive resolution can be achieved for all co-owners.</li>
<li>Our shared objective is to preserve the safety, value, and harmony of our community at 4605 Henri-Bourassa.</li>
<li>Please make informed decisions at the General Assembly based on facts. I will be present, unbiased, and ready to vote for candidates who demonstrate impartiality. If this message resonates, consider running for administration to contribute to transparency and lawful governance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
